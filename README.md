# ☁️ Task 4: Deploy a Serverless Function to the Cloud

## 🎯 Objective
To understand **serverless computing** by creating and deploying a simple **Cloud Run Function** that executes code automatically when triggered — without managing any servers.

This task demonstrates how to use **Function-as-a-Service (FaaS)** on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.
